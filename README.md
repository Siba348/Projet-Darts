# Projet-Darts
Success in darts is not only based on precision and motor skills but also on the underlying statistics that shape the rules of the game. Especially in the range below 170 points, where multiple theoretical possibilities exist to finish the game, some solutions prove to be more tactically advantageous than others. Additionally, many players have individual preferences, as they are more proficient in hitting certain targets.  The objective of the following project is to present all viable combinations, and filter them, enabling the player to become aware of their preferred path as well as possible alternatives.
